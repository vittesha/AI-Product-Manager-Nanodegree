# AI-Product-Manager-Nanodegree

Project 1

I used the Appen platform to built a product which takes the input of chest Xrays and determines if the person has pneumonia or not.



Project 2

I built four machine learning models using Google Cloud AutoML:

1. Clean and Balanced Data
   The dataset consists of 100 healthy images and 100 pneumonia images, all correctly labelled.

2. Clean and Unbalanced Data
    The dataset consists of 100 healthy images and 300 pneumonia images, all correctly labelled.

3. Dirty and balanced Data
    The dataset consists of 100 healthy and 100 pneumonia images, where 30 images of each label are inccorectly labelled.

4. 3 Class Data
    The dataset consists of 100 healthy images, 100 bacterial pneumonia and 100 viral pneumonia images, all correctly labelled.
